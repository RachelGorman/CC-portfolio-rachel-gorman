          <b>Above:</b>"Panic Pete," Alex Modlin's Original Sketch
          <br>
          <b>Background story:</b>Panic Pete is a kind enough sort. He has a flesh-colored, slightly bulbous body with blue balls for eyes and red balls for ears as well as nose. His body has some faint details of a clown outfit, but he doesn’t speak of this chapter in his life. It’s his business alone. Panic Pete is a wanderer now. He helps those dealing with their insecurities and core miseries release their tensions by allowing them to squeeze him. That is the power he has. He is Panic Pete.

            <br>
            <b>Background story:</b>Fashion Robot is extra extra and that’s just how it likes it. It’s built to wear multiple sunglasses at a time. It has no arms, but a body made for draping capes. It has tons of feet so that it never has to choose between shoe options. It’s got two sets of ears for taking in all of your compliments, but it is always green with envy because it can’t wear your fabulous lewk along with its own.

            I really enjoyed this project, and felt that it marked a turning point in my comfort with code. I understood why we were organizing our code more modularly, and enjoyed the feeling of having things a bit "neater" on the page.
            The drawings my partners provided were geometric enough that they weren't overly challenging, but I did get a chance to teach myself how to use beginShape() and endShape() commands to create Panic at the Disco's necklace.
            Figuring out how to make that necklace thin, orange, and on top of the red ellipses that made up the coat felt like a true accomplishment. For the first time, I experienced more joy than abject fear while I was coding, and that was 
            really gratifying. 
      </p><p>
            The one thing I struggled with, was how to create a compound shape with two ellipses so that they shared a single outline, instead of looking like two shapes stacked on top of one another. I look forward to learning that at a later time.
      </p><p>
            As a note: the lab lecture and activity that we did with user-defined functions and parameters was tremendously helpful. I feel like I really wrapped my brain around the code during class time, and it made tackling this homework a lot more fun. Thank you!

        This project was based on an assignment prompt that I received during the course of my CC Lecture and CC Lab classes. Many thanks to 
        <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/prewiredonline/sketches/mA6XRFf-G">this editor</a> for giving me code to help me see x and y coordinates as I work.
