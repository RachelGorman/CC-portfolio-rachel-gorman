      Design and code an experimental clock that expresses a novel way of tracking time.

Originally, I conceived of three different faces that would present visually alternative versions of time.           </p>
      <div class="fullwidth">
        <iframe
          width="400px"
          height="600px"
          src="https://cdn.glitch.com/ee3d0fe7-68ee-4b10-b884-86fd8bc05f6c%2Fsketch%20for%20clock-01.jpg?v=1632194079386"
          alt="concept sketches for the experimental clock"> 
          </iframe>
      </div>
      <br>
       <p>
      My concepts included a "body clock" that would expand and contract as if beating along with someone's heart, an "infinity clock" that 
      slowly spiraled out of frame, and a "labor clock" that was divided into three images that changed every eight seconds, an homage to the old labor slogan <b>"Eight hours for work, eight hours for rest and eight hours for what you will."</b></p>
      <p> 
After talking with class peers and thinking through each concept, I was most excited by the creative possibilities of the labor clock and decided to bring that one alive. </p>

            This was my most challenging class assignment to date. First, I struggled with the if/else commands that would accurately swap my images every eight seconds, and had to go back to watch the tutorials a few times before I was able to make them work correctly. Secondly, 
            I struggled with the images themselves; namely, how to give them enough detail to really stand out from one another and make sense in the context of the slogan. Finally, I decided to superimpose an arc that would count down the seconds over each face and make the 
            entire work more exciting. Working with arcs and angles continues to be difficult for me, and there are still things about this arc that I wish were different (that it started from the same point every time I hit play, for instance). Still, I'm proud of 
            this piece and how much work I put in to making it dynamic and engaging.

        This project was based on an assignment prompt that I received during the course of my CC Lecture and CC Lab classes. Many thanks to 
        <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/prewiredonline/sketches/mA6XRFf-G">this editor</a> for giving me code to help me see x and y coordinates as I work.
