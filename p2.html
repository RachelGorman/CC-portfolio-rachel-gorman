        Original sketches conceived of a range of faces that had organic shapes and colors that ranged between pink and green.

      When I transferred to p5.js and began to experiment with shape-buiding, I quickly realized that my skills gap made it challenging for me to render organic, fluid shapes like I originally intended. 
      I decided to stick with more formal primitive shapes, but keep the eyes and mouth as similar as possible</p>
          <br>
        <p> The face with my larger values:
          </p>

          width="400px"
          height="600px"

          alt="static coded image of a large cartoon face">
          </iframe>
      </div>
          <p> The face with my smaller values:
          </p>
        <div class="fullwidth">
          <iframe
          width="400px"
          height="600px"

          </iframe>
      </div>
  
      <br>
      <p> 
        After randomizing for color, face shape, eye shape, and mouth position, my final result in a looped video demo:

          alt="an animated .gif of the face as it moves through expressions and colors"></iframe>

        <br>
          
      <h1>
        Reflections
      </h1>
          <p>
            Although I wasn't able to easily render the organic shapes that I had initially intended, I think that (after much tinkering) I was
            still able to capture the informality that I had originally tried to convey with my drawings in p5.js. 
            
            After I added interactivity to the piece with user variables and randomized mousePressed functions, I began to really enjoy how dynamic the faces became. I 
            love to see how the faces' shapes and colors change with every click, and how the personality and story behind the characters change alongside. 
      </p>
      <p>
            This project did have challenges for me: I spent a lot of time making sure that the random variable values were large enough to be seen and interesting, but small enough so that the faces didn't
            fall apart. Because I had chosen to drawn unconventional faces to begin with, some of their elements could easily begin to look 
            unrelated if the random variable values made them too far apart. For that reason, I ended up tying the values of some of the smaller elements to the larger ones
            by dividing the user variables of the larger elements by an integer, rather than creating all new user variables to experiment with. I also experimented with changing the mouth shape from a line to an 
            ellipse, so that the minimum value face would better reflect my initial sketches, but I wasn't able to figure out a solution. It's frustrating to be faced with a skills gap, but ultimately I am proud
            that I was able to accomplish adding an interactive element to my code for the first time.

        This project was based on an assignment prompt that I received during the course of my CC Lecture and CC Lab classes. Many thanks to 
        <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/prewiredonline/sketches/mA6XRFf-G">this editor</a> for giving me code to help me see x and y coordinates as I work.
