        Project Description
      </h1>
      <p>I am a very vivid dreamer, and I come from a long line of the same. My family and I like to talk about dreams, interpret them and search for significant, underlying meanings they might convey — even (especially) when dreams are surreal or nonsensical. </p>
      <p>Because I consider dreams to be an important part of my personal life and creative process (and because I am not a competitive, points-based person), I thought it would be interesting to create an exploratory, dream-based game. My idea was to build an environment where the player, as a “mind’s eye,” could awaken and travel from the darkness of a bedroom and through a series of realms by interacting with different, bizarre symbols. My goal was to design each dream symbol and level to be vaguely familiar but never totally meaningful or clear-cut so that the game’s visuals matched the experiences I have when I move through a dream in real life.</p>
      <p>I first designed the game to revolve around discrete, episodic levels that you could choose to interact with before returning to the bedroom scene (see original storyboard below). However, I realized mid-way through the creative process that it would be more accurate and exciting to create a scenario where the player had to fall through a series of different dream experiences before returning to the darkened bedroom at the end of the game.</p>
      <p>To play, a player clicks on the game to begin (to “wake the inner eye”) and then uses the arrow keys to navigate the environment. Each level has a colorful, symbolic object that passes through it that looks completely different from its surrounding environs. When the player moves the eye to collide with that object, they move to a new realm. At the end of the game, they interact with active brainwaves and complete the REM cycle. Finally, the eye closes and returns to the darkened bedroom, ready to dream again with one click.</p>
      <p>After user testing my game on friends and family, the feedback I received was that they liked that the bedroom scene allowed them to “hide” the eye behind some foreground objects. So I added foregrounds to the other levels to give the game more dynamism and make each realm a richer experience.</p>

        Personal Reflection
      </h1>
      <p>
        This game ended up being a joy to create, but there were many trials and tribulations along the way. I leaned on my instructors, peers, and DT tutors to help me troubleshoot some of the more problematic areas of my code. The most challenging issue I faced was ensuring that the dream object symbols I had designed didn’t collide too early with the eye and take a player through the experience too quickly. As it turned out, I had made my code too complex. I resolved the problem by scaling back everything, rewriting for loops to be single, repetitive objects, and adding conditional statements to my checkCollisions. 
      </p>
      <p>
        With Xin's guidance, I experimented with paring my objects down further, making them all one class (https://editor.p5js.org/RachelGorman/sketches/5_2fsUDLo). Eventually, I decided to go back to treating them as distinct entities because it made the code clearer for me to understand fully (and Xin kindly made it clear that understanding my code was ultimately the most important goal).
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoyed getting a chance to design a few surrealist landscapes. And it’s been gratifying for me to hear people’s reactions as they move through levels. There seems to be enough visual contrast between each to make each pop in their unique way, and it’s fun to overhear people’s exclamations as they explore each new realm. I had no idea game design (even at this simple level!) could be so gratifying.

        I am indebted to my professor, Xin, my instructor, Jules, DT tutors Elena and Yuen, and classmates Yash and Hasan who each helped me troubleshoot my code and offered advice when I was stuck. I could not have created this piece without them.
