        Project Objective
      </h1>

      <p> Create a data portrait out of a personal habit of yours.</p>
 

      <!-- 4. reflection -->
      <h1>
        Project Description
      </h1>

      <p> My data portrait reflects the time (in sets of consecutive hours) that I spent either in class or on homework over the course of the week that I was tracking myself. Each column represents a day, starting with Wednesday and ending with Monday. 
      </p>
      <p>The white cubes represent hours (in increments of 50px)spent on homework. The black represents the hours spent in class. I chose the background color to randomize the x location as the blocks fell to reflect the constant frenetic, stressful energy you feel when work assignments begin to accumulate. 
      </p>
      <p>
      The falling motion is meant to evoke feelings of work “stacking up,” but I also wanted to visually nod to being “lost in the stacks” of the library. In the end, you can interpret the data negatively, seeing in the blocks the figure of a wall that separates me from free time, rest, or more leisurely pursuits. You might also interpret the blocks together more positively, seeing instead the beginnings of a (shaky) foundation of knowledge upon which I can build.
      </p>

        Personal Reflection

      <p> 
This data portrait project didn’t reveal anything to me about how my time is spent that I didn’t already know (though truly tracking the hours as they accumulated did take me aback). I think instead, it highlighted for me how many concepts that we’ve covered in class that I am still struggling to understand and use correctly. 
      </p>
      <p>
One of the reasons that this project took so long to create, was because I really tried to incorporate most, or all, of the concepts we learned in class. Unfortunately, my effort failed and I had to start again with a simpler, more straightforward concept. Although I was still able to work with some ideas I hadn’t before, like frameCount and arrays, when I look at my final code I am almost positive that I could use for loops and map/millis functions to make this project more streamlined. I just have a really difficult time conceptualizing where and how they would apply. Even my if/else statements didn’t work as I intended (for some reason, I couldn’t get my else {} commands to achieve what I wanted). I am also not sure why all of my variables had to be globally defined as zero, instead of operating as intended when they were listed simply "let xpos." 
      </p>
      <p>
This project, more than any other, has inspired me to seek extra tutoring through DT study so that I have a better handle on the basics.  In that sense, I guess I gained some real insight!

        This project was based on an assignment prompt that I received during the course of my CC Lecture and CC Lab classes.
