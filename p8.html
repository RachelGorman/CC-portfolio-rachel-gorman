      <p> Design and code an experimental camera that expresses a novel way of capturing a body, a place, or an object.</p>

        Project Description
      </h1>
    
      <p>
      For this project, I explored a lot of different ideas for an alternative camera. First, while sketching, I thought about how images capture our present and distort our memories, obscuring certain places, objects, or moments, in the interest of framing focus on others. Second, I wondered whether I might use a new kind of camera to capture and represent the fluidity of my identity, interests, and moods in a way traditional still images could never. Finally, I explored the possibility of working with a pixelated mosaic to investigate how organic, round beings become 2-dimensional squares when they begin to exist online. 
      </p>
      <p>
        After experimenting with facial tracking and pixel arrays and creating several different filters, colors, and shapes with code, I took a break and aimlessly clicked over to Instagram to decompress. While scrolling, I started to think about how rosily people present themselves and their lives when they pose for a picture — and how often that happy but ultimately flat mood doesn’t reflect how people feel. 
      </p>
      <p>
        With that in mind, I returned to my project and decided to create a critical piece that reflected how distorted and limiting that kind of image-making is. So I combined the facial tracking code we learned in CC Lab with a pixel array filter that changes with mouseX and mouseY.  The result is a camera that always showcases a flat, pink shape in the middle of my face, no matter how the colors of my context (my symbolic mood) change.

        Although the object that I coded to obscure my face is pink, in the end, this is maybe the darkest, most critical project I've created for this class. I guess on some level, that isn't such a surprise. Discussions about images, self-censorship, and facial recognition get dystopic quickly — and for excellent reason. On some level, I enjoyed taking a peek under the curtain to begin to understand how our now-ubiquitous social media filters get made. On another, I'm disturbed by how easy it was to map my features and obscure them with a new object. Working with this code is fun and experimental — but you can see how quickly it can turn into something a lot uglier.
    </p>
    <p>
      One more note: my broswer kept crashing throughout this process, which made it a really frustrating creative process. I wonder if there's a baseline amount of memory/RAM that is required to be able to work with cameras in p5.js more smoothly. If there is, I'm pretty sure my Mac Air doesn't meet the standard.

        I was inspired by the clmtrackr examples created by Jules Kris and Xin Xin this week. Particularly the pixel array examples that Katherine shared in the tutorial, and <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/Kcaden20/sketches/xDe-9ncMW">this sketch</a>by Kcaden.
