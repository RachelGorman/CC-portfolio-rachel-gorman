          <p>
For this assignment, I focused on designs I experienced in my childhood home. Although my parents did not surround themselves with many patterns (my mother was vehemently opposed to wallpaper), we did have a black and white tile pattern on our bathroom floor that I would stare out for hours when I was a very little kid. 
      </p>
<p>The more I thought about that tile pattern and similar 20th-century black and white motifs, the more I felt like one could serve as a visual metaphor for the white American culture in which I grew up. The basketweave, the tile pattern that I ultimately coded,  is a design that dates back to the 1920s. It is made to look like an expensive mosaic but can be purchased in large blocks â€” a tidy example of the American middle class' obsession with both mass manufacturing and the shallow veneer of upward mobility. As a black and white pattern, it also visualizes Western dualisms like good vs. evil, light vs. dark, and nature vs. culture. When placed on the diagonal, it conjures deeply American references like latticework fencing and the top of an apple pie.
</p>
<p> Perhaps most obviously, this black and white tile pattern can serve as a visual metaphor for American history of racial subjugation. The optical illusion that I coded is meant to underscore that interpretation by calling attention to how an interlocking white network interrupts and disallows greater black participation and involvement. When you first experience the canvas, the basketweave is invisible, reflecting how easily white supremacy hides the informal and formal power structures that perpetuate it. Only when you "experience" the canvas by hovering over it do you understand the underlying interconnections that keep white people at the forefront of American culture and economic success.</p>
      <p> On the technical side, I struggled with for loops (and particulary, nested for loops), and had to seek help to make sure that I was implementing my optical illusion correctly. I struggled with conceptualizing how loops worked, and keeping multiple strains of information in my head long enough to implement my nested for loops correctly.

      <p>
        Special thanks to my classmate, KT, who helped me interpret the basketweave and gave me a sense of how I might be able to break apart the pattern long enough to code it. I also want to thank Xin Xin, Jules Kris, and Katherine Moriwaki 
        for their help troubleshooting my design and helping me bring it to life.

        This project was based on an assignment prompt that I received during the course of my CC Lecture and CC Lab classes. Many thanks to 
        <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/prewiredonline/sketches/mA6XRFf-G">this editor</a> for giving me code to help me see x and y coordinates as I work.
