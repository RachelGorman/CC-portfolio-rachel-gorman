      <h1>
        Project Description
      </h1>
    
      <p>For this project, I designed and built a tool that we could use to monitor and track how government and corporate entities track and monitor those with less power than they have. After exploring several ideas, I decided to create an interactive data exploration that called attention to the national media's sporadic, strange coverage of an ongoing national disaster: the rapid, irreversible depletion of the natural wetlands that protect Louisiana's coast.</p>  

<p>The gulf coast is in crisis. Over the last century, the United States has lost vast portions of our coastal wetlands, particularly the areas of land found in south Louisiana. The rate of loss is already cataclysmic and only getting worse. Today, research studies suggest that we are losing, on average, a football field's worth of land every hour.</p>

<p>Louisianan wetlands are an environmental and cultural resource we can't afford to lose. They are among the most biologically diverse and productive ecosystems on the planet — a habitat and shelter for thousands of birds, insects, shellfish and fish, shrimp, plants, and larger animals on par with the rainforest and coral reefs. In addition, they are of extreme cultural and economic importance to the region's tribal populations, including the Chitimacha, the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw, and the Pointe-au-Chien Indian Tribe, among others. Finally, they help enhance water quality and discourage soil erosion. And they are the state's best defense against hurricane damage and storm surge, something that will only increase in importance as climate change increases and intensifies hurricane season.</p> 

<p>The land loss in Louisiana is not natural nor inevitable; it is caused by human activity. Levees along the Mississippi River, built to protect human property and homes, ultimately disallow the river to deposit more sediment onto the land as it floods. Oil extraction, a significant economic driver in the region, depletes underground resources and exacerbates sinking land. And climate change-induced sea-level rise makes the gulf an ever-growing threat to coastal land.
</p>
<p>Despite the loss, large outlets in the national news media, in this piece represented by the New York Times, pay little to no attention to this ongoing, ultimately preventable emergency. They rarely cover the coastline except in times of breaking news; they hardly ever call bad actors like oil and gas companies to account. This piece pulls Louisiana coastline-related headlines from the last ten years. It presents them, one at a time, against a <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/featured-images/underwater-land-loss-coastal-louisiana-1932">NOAA image</a>that compares land loss from 1932 to 2011. By juxtaposing the breaking news headlines and the long-term image, I hope to highlight and contrast how sporadic, episodic, and sometimes bizarre news coverage of the region can be. Wetland depletion is an ongoing catastrophe; we're losing vital American environmental, biological, economic, and cultural resources daily. Tribal members have been forced to relocate away from ancestral land. Yet, it goes largely unnoticed by a media obsessed with the latest, breaking news.

        Personal Reflection
      </h1>
      <p>In order to build out a sousveillence tool that worked, I had to learn how to access an external entities' API and draw relevant JSON datasets I found there into my sketch in p5.js. The process was really challenging. While exploring different project ideas, I tried to access datasets from NASA, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the Census, among others. Each had stringent rules and opaque instructions, with arbitrary rules around query responses that made it almost impossible to navigate.</p>
      <p>When I finally decided to focus on the New York Times' API tool, I still ran into technical issues. The datasets didn't load properly without certain call functions written into my p5.js code, and even then only came in useless clumps of information. I worked closely with Xin and Jules to identify the problematic areas of my code and figure out how to best pull data and utilize it creatively. Even though my project evolved a number of times while I was working on it, I'm still proud of the final result.

      <p>Many thanks to Xin and Jules for helping me navigate the New York Times' API query instructions and figure out how to pull the correct datasets.
