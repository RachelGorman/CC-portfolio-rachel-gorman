        Project Objective
      </h1>

      <p> To revise my alternative camera by adding a consentful interface.</p>
 

      <!-- 4. reflection -->
      <h1>
        Project Description
      </h1>
    
      <p>First, I considered the camera's user experience and where it might infringe on people's rights or privacy. Even though the camera blocks people's faces, I felt that it was necessary to warn people that their environment will appear on screen for the duration of their experience. I also wanted to be explicit about what the camera would *not* do. In a time when so many internet experiences track and save personal information in silence, I wanted to make sure that I stated, quite plainly, that this camera would not be doing anything of that sort. 
      </p>
      <p>
        At first, I developed a concept that showed participants several screens that they had to move through before experiencing the camera. However, after running through it a few times myself and with others, it seemed apparent that too many screens would bog down the user experience and that I could impart the same information by being thoughtful about how to present it. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Moving through my designs, I also realized that a consentful interface, with its emphasis on information, gave me an excellent opportunity to spell out my artistic intentions and provide instruction to users before they began working with my camera. I also added the ability to take a photo/save it to your desktop with any key and back buttons to ensure a user could always revisit the information I had presented (and revoke their consent, if necessary).
      </p>
      
      <!-- 4. reflection -->
      <h1>
        Personal Reflection
      </h1>
      <p>
        My consentful interface responds to FRIES by giving users clear, straightforward information about the project up front before interacting with my camera. It asks them to check a box to ensure that they enthusiastically consent to have their environment appear on camera. There are back buttons throughout to ensure that they can reverse their decision or re-read the information. I also include information about what my camera does not do (track their information or save it in any way) to ensure they know that they aren't consenting to only a specific range of activities.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think incorporating a consentful interface helps flesh out and enrich the user experience. As I mentioned above, giving audiences information about what they would experience with my camera allowed me to explain my artistic intentions and encourage them to interact in specific ways. Before this assignment, I have only had the opportunity to explain my work *around* it, i.e., on this webpage. I'm excited to include that information *within* the context of my code now. It is gratifying to know that no matter how or where someone experiences my work, they will always know how and why I designed the way I have and can freely choose whether to proceed.
